# Food-Waste-Reduction-System
The Food Waste Reduction System is a system designed to address the issue of food waste by connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and consumers with surplus food. The system aims to prevent food waste by facilitating the redistribution of excess food to those in need, thereby reducing environmental impact and promoting food security.
