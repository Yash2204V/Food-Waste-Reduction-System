_"Food Sustainability & Recovery System"_
The Food Waste Reduction System is a system designed to address the issue of food waste by connecting restaurants, grocery stores, and consumers with surplus food. The system aims to prevent food waste by facilitating the redistribution of excess food to those in need, thereby reducing environmental impact and promoting food security.

**The Food Waste Reduction App serves the following stakeholders:**
Restaurants and Grocery Stores: Businesses seeking to reduce food waste and contribute to community welfare by diverting surplus food from landfills.
Consumers: Individuals interested in purchasing affordable and environmentally friendly surplus food while supporting local businesses and reducing food waste.
Food Banks and Charities: Organizations focused on alleviating hunger and food insecurity in communities by redistributing surplus food to those in need.

In this system, the tech stack includes: html, css, javascript, express.js, mongodb.js, python, flask, langchain.

Needy Access:
"Needy Access is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate easy access for those in need to request available food donations, with a focus on promoting accessibility and transparency."

Chatbot:
"Our intelligent chatbot serves as a knowledgeable assistant, offering information and guidance on food management, donation procedures, and available resources, empowering users at every step of the process."

Support Tracking:
"Our robust tracking system, built with Python and Flask, diligently monitors the expiry status of donated food items. This ensures that expiry dates are closely monitored, facilitating timely distribution to those in need."

1. **Donator and Reciever Database**, donations visible in the user module.
2. **Chatbot** with specified suggestions for the sustainable food waste management.
